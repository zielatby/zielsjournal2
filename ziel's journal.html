<br>Hello! My name is Azriel Elaine S. Atabay!I am currently a 8th grade student in Honorato C. Perez Sr. Memorial Science Highschool. I was born at August 3, 2011 , which makes me 12 years old this year. Some of my favorite hobbies or talents are Taekwondo and drawing.Describing myself is one of the toughest tasks to do, but it's fascinating too. to put it to words. I believe our traits - be they positive or negative - make us the person we are to the world. When it comes to my personality, people can have different opinions because they see what they want to see in me. and that's okay. So, I would describe myself from the paradigm I see myself from in different aspects.
<br>
As a person. I believe life is an art, and I am the artist of my life. I try to keep it full of colors and as cheerful as possible no matter what life throws at me. I am an enthusiast and a person full of curiosity. Curious to know what life is all about and what it holds in the future
<br>
I like to keep a smile on my face no matter what I am going through, and that smile keeps me going. Besides, I was brought up in a multicultural community.Aside from that , I can also be a shy person or what you can call an introvert. I am not much of the type of making friends or socializing but once you really get to know me , I can be a really different person!
<br>
Althought shy and timid, I also get along very well with families and new people, I have been close to many peopleâ€™s hearts and instantly clicked with them.
